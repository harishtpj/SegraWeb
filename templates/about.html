        About Segra
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Segra is a smart waste segregation system designed to promote responsible
        waste disposal using AI-powered classification and reward-based gamification.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Users dispose waste in a smart dustbin which automatically classifies the waste
        and directs it to the appropriate bin. After disposal, users are rewarded with
        <strong>EcoCoins</strong> that encourage sustainable behavior.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Segra also enables sustainability-focused clubs and organizations to conduct
        <strong>EcoDrives</strong>, allowing participants to contribute more while
        maintaining system integrity.
    </p>
